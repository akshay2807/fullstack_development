    <h1>Leopard</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a member of the cat
        family, Felidae.[4] It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of Western and Central Asia,
        <a href="no">Southern</a> Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East Asia. It is listed as
        Vulnerable on the
        IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in
        large parts of the global range. The leopard is considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea,
        Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia
        and most likely in North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel.[3] Contemporary records
        suggest that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.[5][6]

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>The English name 'leopard' comes from Old French: leupart or Middle French: liepart, that derives from Latin:
        leopardus and Ancient Greek: λέοπάρδος (leopardos). Leopardos could be a compound of λέων (leōn), meaning lion,
        and πάρδος (pardos), meaning spotted.[10][11][12] The word λέοπάρδος originally referred to a cheetah (Acinonyx
        jubatus).[13]

    <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
        Felis pardus was the scientific name proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758.[42] The generic name Panthera was first
        used by Lorenz Oken in 1816, who included all the known spotted cats into this group.[43] Oken's classification
        was not widely accepted, and Felis or Leopardus was used as the generic name until the early 20th century.[44]
        The leopard was designated as the type species of Panthera by Joel Asaph Allen in 1902.[45] In 1917, Reginald
        Innes Pocock also subordinated the tiger (P. tigris), lion (P. leo), and jaguar (P. onca) to Panthera.
