    <h2>Subspecies</h2>
    <p>Following Linnaeus's first descriptions of the species, several tiger specimens were described and proposed as subspecies. 
        <sup><a href="abcd.com">[12]</a>  </sup>[12] 
        The validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999. Most putative subspecies described in the 19th and 20th 
        centuries were distinguished on basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size, hence characteristics 
        that vary widely within populations. Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between
         populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene. Therefore, it was proposed to 
         recognize only two tiger subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater 
         Sunda Islands.[13]</p>
